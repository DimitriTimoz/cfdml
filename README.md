# Solution for the NeurIPS 2024 Challenge 

This repository contains our solution for the NeurIPS 2024 Challenge. 

We are working on the task of predicting the airflows constrained by the geometry of an airfoil.
The objective of the challenge is to predict the pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and velocity fields around an airfoil given the geometry of the airfoil and the incoming flow conditions.
